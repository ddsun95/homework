		\item \textbf {\underline{Problem 1:}} Design 3 algorithms based on binary min heaps that find the $k$th smallest \# out of a set of $n$ \#'s in time:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item[a)] $O(n \log k)$
			\item[b)] $O(n + k \log n)$
			\item[c)] $O(n + k \log k)$
		\end{enumerate}
		\textbf{Note:} For all problems, an array will be used to represent the heap. \newline
		\newline
		a) For part a, we initially allocate an array of size $k$ for our heap with all the elements initialized to $-\infty$ \emph{(according to CLRS, a heap containing all duplicate keys can still be classified as a valid min-heap).}
		Then, we will make a pass through our array $A$ from $A[1 \dots length[A]]$. For each $A_i$ where $i \in$ $\lbrace 1 \dots length[A] \rbrace$, check if $-A_i$ is greater than the minimum of the heap. If such is the case, call remove on the heap, and insert $-A_i$ into the heap. We apply this operation for $length[A]$ iterations. Once we've scanned through all the elements in $A$, the $kth$ smallest element should be $-1 * smallest(heap)$.
		\newline
		\textbf{Correctness for a:} If we want the $k$th smallest element, we would scan through the array and keep track of a k element list. If an element in the array $A_i$ is less than the maximum element $L_{max}$ in the list, replace $L_{max}$ with $A_i$. Thus, by the end of one pass through the array, the k-element list will contain the k smallest elements in the array. However, the constraint in part a is that only the smallest element can be removed. In this case, we construct a heap using the negatives of the array elements. Thus if the $negative$ of an array element is $greater$ $than$ the minimum heap value, then replace the minimum heap value with the negative of the array element. Since $\forall a, b \in \mathbb{R}$, if $a > b$ then $-b > -a$, replacing the minimum value in the heap containing negatives is equivalent of replacing the maximums in a max-heap. By the end of one pass through the array, the min-heap would contain the negatives of the k-smallest values with the k-th smallest of the array as the smallest value of the heap.
